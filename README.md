Preliminary test
----------------
### Question 1
From an input list of 4 elements (A, B, C, D), generate the corresponding "multiset" (6 elements: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD).  

### Question 2
From an input text format file `book.txt`, generate the ranking list of the most frequent words.

Exercise 1
----------
Write a Python script to list all possible DNA sequences of length n.  
Propose a second and alternative solution.

Exercise 2
----------
The `glycemia.csv` file contains blood sugar levels (g/L) measured at six moments of the day, in five different patients.  
The CSV format (comma-separated values) may be opened with a spreadsheet (e.g. Excel), but it may also be read as a text file. Its values are separated by `;`.

### Question 1
Create a Python script that can read this CSV file and write a new one that is identical but with an additional column containing the blood sugar level averaged over the six times, for each individual.

### Question 2
Complete the above script to make it able to write an additional line to the table: it will contain the blood sugar level averaged over the five individuals, for each of the six times.
